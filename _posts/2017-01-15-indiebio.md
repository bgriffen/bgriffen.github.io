The last four months have been mental.

Last August I was coming to the end of my postdoc in astrophysics at MIT about to head to Germany and now I'm running a company, pitching to investors, learning about microfluidics, conducting job interviews, growing neurons from stem cells and trying to find better ways to kill cancer.

It's as though I've gone from being a mammal to being an insect. I've traded a slower pace of life in a small pond to a lightning fast pace of life in a very large pond. I won't use your time to go on about my reasons for signing up for all of this but rather take some time to tell you about the companies that are in my current batch at Indie Bio, the world's largest biotech accelerator.

Indie Bio is a unique kind of place. It is the "biotech arm" of the venture capital firm SOSV headed by Sean O'Sullivan. SOSV has funded 55 biotech companies over the past two years with 10-15 companies in each batch making up four batches overall (summer and winter seasons). They additionally fund operations ranging from consumer hardware (HAX) to Food Tech (Food-X). You can find a list of their portfolio companies [here](https://sosv.com/portfolio/).

The reason Indie Bio is unique is because it offers a certain kind of environment that can't be found anywhere else. All companies are thrown into a canon at the start of the four month program and are launched at an accelerated rate with the hope of disrupting entire industries. As is often the mantra around San Francisco, "it isn't enough to innovate, you have to disrupt".

We've all still got a long road ahead of us but I can tell you now, just three weeks from demo day (the culmination of the program), that I'm very glad I signed up all those months ago. If you're an academic, the closest way I can describe the experience is that it's like the last three months of your PhD except every week you've got to tell the department your three major highlights from the past week and the tasks you are doing in a given day are vastly more diverse.

Rather than repeating the corporate platitudes you might find on media platforms, I've taken the liberty to describe the current Indie Bio class with a brief mention of my fellow co-founders.

If you would like to find more information about any of the companies listed below, head to Indie Bio's [portfolio page](http://indiebio.co/companies/) and sort by "2016 Winter".

### A2A 

A2A is a computational drug design company which centers around the SCUPLT software developed by Matthew Welch which uses machine learning to match drugs to targets. 

Acting CEO Ed Painter is one of the older guys of the batch but has a wealth of experience. I hope he has an unlimited phone plan because he is constantly arranging meetings, developing relationships and all-round hustling to bring the potential of their platform to the world. I've never seen so many business cards after three days of meetings.

### Animal Biome

Did you know there are more dogs and cats than there are children in the United States? Our pets however can suffer similar problems to such as diabetes and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The power of the microbiome to treat these conditions is now becoming known by the mainstream. Animal Biome have a product which offers an effective treatments for our sick pets.

CEO Holly Ganz is a microbial ecologist out of UC Davis and an all-round lover of cats, dogs and wildlife. She even sports the "talk to me about cat poop" shirt at events around Indie Bio! You immediately know Holly genuinely cares deeply about the health of our companion animals. Her "poop pills" are already a hit, providing immediate health benefits to her customer's pets. 


### BioInspira

Viruses are usually considered "bad things" but the team at BioInspira are using them (or more specifcally "phages") to create a mini-chemical sensor to detect oil and gas leaks for the petroleum and gas industries. More than that, they are creating a chemical sensing network to provide real-time feedback of entire operations.


Ray and Benson have been going from strength to strength. Whilst we've all joked about our apprehension about having aerosol viruses in the lab, I've been amazed at their progress over the last four months. Just last week Ray held up their alpha-product which can be held in the palm of your hands. It is set to get a whole lot smaller and cheaper to produce and I look forward to seeing what they come up with over the coming months.

### Catalog 

"Infinite Data Archives" pretty much says it all. Nate "ukelele" Roquet and Hyunjun Park are storing digital information in DNA molecules. They've already stored 1kb and are well on their way to 1 Mb in time for demo day. They want to shrink down giant storage facilities and put them in test tubes. DNA lasts longer and has far higher storage density than hard drives or tapes so it seems like an inevitable technology because nature has already done better than we ever could.

I've enjoyed talking about cosmology with Nate between discussions around how they encode DNA and have had a few great weekend sessions with Hyunjun. One day the weather will clear up so we can go hiking.

### DxRx 

Alcohol is a problem. The team at DxRx have an app powered tele-medicine approach to allow people to control their alcohol addition. Using effective medication, social support, a coach and accountability via an app, they aim to tame the growing epidemic of heavy drinkers and give life back to those who are losing grip of it.

They are seated right behind us and its hard not to get in a jousting match with their CSO Dr. John Mendelson. I'm hard pressed to find someone to match his razor sharp wit. I've also been enjoying conversations with their CTO Bob Nix, one of the chillest and most experienced guys in tech I've met in a long while.

### Mendel.ai

Matching clinical trials with patients using artificial intelligence. Oncologists can't digest all clinical trial data being produced every day and so patients are missing out on access to novel treatments. Mendel are changing that by using machine learning to digest the thousands of clinical trials out there and match them to patients waiting for solutions.

CEO Karim Galil, much like Holly of Animal Biome, has a certain genuineness about him which is hard to find in the consumer electronics side of San Francisco. One reason he is deeply motivated by their cause is because the problem he is addressing has affected his own family members. I've also had some good python chats with Bernal who is dangerously chill on a level that only Dan (Venomyx) and Steve (Pure Cultures) could compare.

### Neuroqore

To treat depression, some people go through the archaic method of electro-convulsive therapy. Its archaic not very effective -- experts like CEO Mehran, believe things have to change. At Neuroqore, they use deep transcranial magnetic stimulation to as an effective, non-drug, non-invasive way to treat depression.

### Pure Cultures

Antibiotics are a big problem -- so big that the FDA is restricting the use of them more and more every year. A solution to this is to create pro-biotics which improves hatch to harvest times and the health of livestock. Pure Cultures out of Denver Colorado aim to do just that and already have products on the market which achieve both those goals and more.

CEO Steve Kazemi is the sort of guy who combines a certain mountain chill with rural genuineness and business acumen. He also does a killer Guns n' Roses performance when the timing is right. He also brings the Indie Bio family together for campfire-like chats when things get tough -- something we all appreciate.

### Ravata Solutions:

Mice are the workhorse animal of the biotech industry. This is because scientists use, amongst other things, mice as "model humans" for testing our treatments before we get them from our doctor. Currently, highly trained PhDs put genetic material into mouse embryos via a technique called micro-injection. This is literally where you take a needle and one by one, introduce genetic material to illicit a genetic change in the mouse. Its slow, expensive and stuck in the past. Using basically a microchip, Ravata aim to create thousands of trans-genetic embryos every hour by applying an electric voltage, instead of using injection, to place genetic material inside an embryo.

If you ever want to get a glimpse at what pure, unbridled "can-do-anything" mentality looks like, then look no further than Sufi and Arshia of Ravata Solutions. We actually interviewed these guys as part of the diligence work around selecting companies back in September. They literally had only a sheet of paper with an idea of what they wanted to do. Between their insane sleeping patterns and penchant for bringing their laundry in to work, they now have working microchips and have become fathers by giving birth to their first litter of mice. 

### GEA Enzymes

Being able to turn saturated fat into unsaturated fat opens up a whole new portal into different kinds of foods and products worldwide. GEA Enzymes combine computational chemistry with hardcore biochemistry to achieve just this process all the whilst keeping the unsaturated fat liquid at room temperature. Think of healthy dark chocolate being liquid at room temperature. 

Leo heads the operation with Francia and Juan -- all out of Chile. They had some visa issues at the start but we're all glad they finally made it as they've added a certain energy to the place, especially on Karaoke nights!

### Viaex 

Filtration is stuck in the past. Viaex have taken a page out of nature, specifically the endoskeleton of lobsters to build a nano-filtration solution which is much more selective (you can remove contaminants of different sizes) and environmentally sustainable (biodegradable).

Vivian and Felix have had a really rough trip for the first half of Indie Bio. One of their industrial electro-spinners fell off the back of a truck during transit and completely halted their ability to produce filtration membranes. This hasn't stopped them though -- they have powered on and are getting good early traction. I have a special place in my heart for all things German and it has been great to share some old stories with Felix.

### Venomyx Therapeutics

Universal snake anti-venom. Currently, people uses horses to make one anti-venom for one snake bite. This is seriously archaic. Dan "Danimal" Dempsey and Deepankar "don't mention the cricket" Roy are out to change all that. They are developing universal snake anti-venom so that one key can open many locks and that's not even the best part. The best part is that you can carry it in your backpack because it can be used at room temperature which means rural farmers can administer it without the need for refrigeration.

We sit directly opposite these awesome guys. If you ever want a taste of California, talk to Dan. If you ever want a taste of India, go to Little Delhi with Deepankar. I just want to say I've enjoyed nothing better than seeing Deepankar hammering around in a suit and tie spreading the good gospel of Venomyx. 

Anyway, I'll wrap it up here for now but if you ever want to come and chat to these companies or check out Indie Bio whilst we are still here, please shoot me an email and I'll give you a tour. Similarly, if you want to talk to any of the folks I just mentioned, please let me know and I'll put you in contact.

Lastly, our demo day is February 9th and [tickets are now available](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indiebio-asf-demo-day-feb-9th-2017-at-herbst-theater-tickets-30821845971). If you can't make it, be sure to tune in to the live stream!

I'll chat more about the academia-startup transition a little while later. I just wanted to promote my fellow classmates with what time I could spare.
