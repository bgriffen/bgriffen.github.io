        Cell based medicine is the future of medicine. Whilst small molecule traditional drugs have their place, there is a real chance that we will be able to outright cure many diseases within the next 5-10 years with a wholly new type of technology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why is there there such optimism now? Something remarkable happend in 2006. Prof. Shinya Yamanaka, found that the introduction of just four genes encoding transcription factors can convert adult blood cells into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell">pluripotent stem cells</a>; meaning they can theoretically turn into any tissue of the human body. Woah. He subsequently was awarded the Nobel prize in medicine in 2012 for this discovery.

        Applications of this new technology are opening the door to an entirely new type of medicine allowing us to grow patient specific organs (e.g. kidney for renal disease) or regenerate damaged tissue (e.g. special neurons for Parkinson's). 
        <br>
        <br>
        But where are they? The reason these treatments have been delayed from reaching our family members is because there are serious bottlenecks in the way we do experimental biology. These bottlenecks include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>high manual labor costs (carried out by our best and brightest minds) </li>
        <li>serial experimentation (a handful of experiments run at any one time)</li>
        <li>segmented workflows (consisting of excessive human intervention)</li>
        <li>high cost of goods (we still do “bucket biology” in large format equipment)</li>
        </ul>

        Overall, we are throwing the same inefficient processes at increasingly complex problems. We wanted to upgrade this approach which is why we created our company, <a href="http://www.scaledbiolabs.com/"><b>Scaled Biolabs</b></a>. 

        <br>
         <br>
        Our core technology allows us to carry out <b>thousands of experiments simultaneously</b>, with minimal human handling and material. We achieve this by shrinking down many of the tasks ordinarily done in a full scale research lab and coupling it to a data driven pipeline for turning thousands of experiments into deep biological insight.

        <br>
         <br>

        <br>
        Although "lab-on-a-chip" and microfluidics isn't a new idea, the primary application has been in diagnostics (eg. blood screening) or genomics (eg. sequencing), not <strong>cell culture</strong> (i.e. the process of growing and culturing cells). We believe our system is the best in the world for doing just that, listening to cells. 
        
            <br>
            <br>
            Using this technology our collaborators have already had great success <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7574/full/nature15695.html">understanding how to grow human kidney in a dish</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24637">beating human heart tissue</a>, for example. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In industry, we believe our technology is the best at reducing the complexity and cost of turning stem cells into different tissues of the human body. We make it easier, cheaper and faster for companies to grow certain types of cell products who have traditionally been faced with major R&amp;D production and scaling bottlenecks.
            <br>
            <br>
            We not only help other companies but also use our technology to achieve our own goals internally. We recently <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/about-cirm/newsroom/press-releases/06292017/stem-cell-agency-invests-more-44-million-treatments">won a grant via California's stem cell agency</a> to grow dopamine producing neurons for treating Parkinson's disease, for example. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We've only scratched the surface though. Our system is also compatible with many exciting new cell based therapies coming out, such as immunotherapies, where we leverage the body's own immune system to fight cancer.
