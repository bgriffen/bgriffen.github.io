        In the past five years, there has been a lot of promise in the areas of cell therapies and immuno-therapy of not just treatments for patients, but entire cures. 
        <br>
        <br>
        These new types of medicines allow for damaged tissue to regenerate (or grow your own organs entirely) or to augment the body’s own immune system to fight cancer and disease more efficiently. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The reason these treatments have been delayed from reaching the clinic is because there are serious bottlenecks in the way we do experimental biology. These bottlenecks include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>high manual labor costs (carried out by our best and brightest minds) </li>
        <li>serial experimentation (a handful of experiments run at any one time)</li>
        <li>segmented workflows (consisting of excessive human intervention)</li>
        <li>high cost of goods (we still do “bucket biology” in large format equipment)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Overall, we are throwing the same inefficient processes at increasingly complex problems. We wanted to upgrade this approach which is why we created our company, <a href="http://www.scaledbiolabs.com/"><b>Scaled Biolabs</b></a>. 

        <br>
         <br>
        Our technology allows us to carry out <b>thousands of experiments simultaneously</b>, with minimal human handling and material. We achieve this by shrinking down many of the tasks ordinarily done in a full scale research lab onto a chip no bigger than your phone. 

        <br>
         <br>

        <br>
        Although "lab-on-a-chip" isn't a new idea, its primary applications have been in diagnostics (eg. blood screening) or genomics (eg. sequencing genomes), not <strong>cell culture</strong> (i.e. the process of growing and culturing cells). We believe our system is the best in the world for doing just that, listening to cells.

            <br>
            <br>
            Using this technology, our collaborators have already had great success <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7574/full/nature15695.html">using our technology to grow human kidney</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24637">beating human heart tissue</a>, for example. We're excited to now apply this technology to other areas of human health.
