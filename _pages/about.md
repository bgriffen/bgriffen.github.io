I am currently co-founder and Chief Information Officer at Scaled Biolabs Inc. based in San Fransisco, California where I design and develope workhorse tools for cell culture and analysis in biomedical R&D labs. I received my PhD in astrophysics at the Unviersity of Queensland, Australia in 2012 before completing my postdoctoral work at the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In my capacity as an astrophysicist, I am currently leading the [Caterpillar Project](http://www.caterpillarproject.org) with the objective of better understanding the formation of the Milky Way and its satellite companions. This work is being carried out across the [Kavli Institute](http://space.mit.edu/â€Ž) at [MIT](http://mit.edu), [Michigan State University](http://www.pa.msu.edu/astro/Astronomy.html) and the [MPA](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/) in Garching, Germany.

I am also interested in a wide variety of other fields including [using large semantic datasets](http://brendangriffen.com/) as a window into human nature, linguistics and anthropology. 

You can what I've found interesting in the astronomy literature [here](https://delicious.com/bgriffen).
