        Hi. I use technology to understand the following:
        <ul>
        <li>complex biological systems</li>
        <li>the origin of our universe</li>
        <li>the development of human ideas</li>
        <li>how better to educate the next generation</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You can find a little bit about each of these on parts of this website. On a more personal level, here is a bit more about me.
        <h5>

        <h4>
        <strong>First Decade</strong>
        </h4>
        <h5>
             I was born in Hong Kong and then moved through various cities in Australia, finally ending up in Bargara, Queensland. I played a boat load of sports and dabbled with a musical side but ultimately set on science and mathematics as my main pursuit.

        <h4>
        <strong>Second Decade</strong>
        </h4>
        <h5>
            I moved to Brisbane and studied physics, mathematics and philosophy for my undergraduate degree at the <a href="http://smp.uq.edu.au/content/uq-astrophysics">University Of Queensland</a> followed by a Masters and PhD in computational astrophysics. Much of my time was spent in Brighton (UK) and Heidelberg (Germany). <br> 
        </h5>

        <br>

        <h4>
        <strong>Third Decade</strong>
        </h4>
        <h5>
            I moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA) to continue my astrophysics research as a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Whilst at MIT I designed and developed <a href="http://www.caterpillarproject.org">The Caterpillar Project</a>, the largest number of high-resolution Milky Way simulations achieved thus far and contributed to the processing pipeline of <a href="http://www.illustris-project.org">The Illustris Project</a> which is still one of the most complex astrophysical simulations of our universe done to date.
        </h5>

        <br>

        <h4>
        <strong>Now</strong>
        </h4>
        <h5>
            I've taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research and moved to San Francisco, California. With two others I co-founded <a href="http://www.scalebiolabs.com">Scaled Biolabs</a>, a company focused on accelerating the advent of the next generation of cell and gene therapies. I recently completed my time in the biotech accelerator <a href="http://sf.indiebio.co/">Indie Bio</a>.
