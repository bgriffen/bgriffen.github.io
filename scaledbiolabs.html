            The current pharmaceutical approach is failing patients worldwide. 

            <br>
            <br>
            A drug, no matter how sophisticated, will not save you from organ failure. All is not lost though; there is a great deal of optimism for recent therapies now available which will not just treat you, but <i>cure</i> you entirely.

            <br>
            <br>

            Why is there such optimism now? New discoveries and treatments in three areas, cell therapies (e.g. using stem cells to grow human tissue), biologics (e.g. immunotherapy) and gene therapies (e.g. fixing genetic errors) are giving hints of a very new kind of medicine never before seen.

            <br>
            <br>

            The problem is that these nascent areas are not living up to their full potential because the biological processes they aim to tame are simply too complex. Compounding this problem is that current scientific research is done in a slow, serial (e.g. one experiment at a time) and time-intensive manner whilst patients are waiting in hospital beds.

            <br>
            <br>

            We wanted to revolutionize this approach and accelerate the development process which is why we created our company, <a href="http://www.scaledbiolabs.com/"><b>Scaled Biolabs</b></a>. Our patented technology allows us to carry out <b>thousands of experiments simultaneously</b>, with minimal human handling and material. We achieve this by shrinking down many of the tasks ordinarily done in a full scale research lab onto a chip no bigger than your phone.

            <br>
            <br>

            Our collaborators have already had great success <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7574/full/nature15695.html">using our technology to grow human kidney</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24637">beating human heart tissue</a>, for example. Patients out there are still waiting though which is why we've create this company to accelerate the arrival of a new age of medicine.

            If you're interested in learning more about our technology or where we are headed, head to <a href="http://www.scaledbiolabs.com">our website</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/scaled-biolabs">subscribe to our blog</a>. We're currently immersed in the biotech accelerator, <a href="http://sf.indiebio.co/">Indie Bio</a> in downtown San Francisco. <br>
