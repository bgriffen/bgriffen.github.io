            The current pharmaceutical approach is failing patients worldwide. 

            <br>
            <br>
            A drug, no matter how sophisticated, will not save you from organ failure. All is not lost though; there is great optimism for new therapies being developed which will not just treat you, but <i>cure</i> you entirely.

            <br>
            <br>

            Why is there such optimism now? New discoveries and treatments in three spaces; cell therapies (e.g. using stem cells to grow human tissue), biologics (e.g. immunotherapy) and gene therapies (e.g. fixing genetic errors) are giving hints of a very new kind of medicine never before seen.

            <br>
            <br>

            The problem is that these nascent areas are not living up to their full potential because the biological processes they aim to tame are simply too complex.

            <br>
            <br>

            Compounding this problem is that current scientific research is done in a slow, serial (e.g. one experiment at a time) and time-intensive manner whilst patients are waiting in hospital beds.

            <br>
            <br>

            At Scaled Biolabs, we aim to revolutionize this approach and accelerate the current development process. Our technology allows us to carry out <b>thousands of experiments in parallel</b>, with minimal human handling and material. We achieve this by shrinking down many of the tasks ordinarily done in a full scale research lab onto a chip no bigger than your phone.

            <br>
            <br>

            Our collaborators in an academic setting have already had great success <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7574/full/nature15695.html">using this technology to grow human kidney</a> and beating human heart tissue, for example. Patients out there are still waiting though which is why we've create this company to accelerate the arrival of a new age of medicine.

            If you're interested in learning more about our technology or where we are headed, head to <a href="http://www.scaledbiolabs.com">our website</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/scaled-biolabs">subscribe to our blog</a>. We're currently immersed in the biotech accelerator, <a href="http://sf.indiebio.co/">Indie Bio</a> in downtown San Francisco. Come check out our lab and what we're working on if you're ever in town - seriously!
