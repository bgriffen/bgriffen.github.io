![Sample of the Caterpillar halos][caterpillar]

The goal of the [Caterpillar Project](http://caterpillar.scripts.mit.edu/www/) is to use relatively inexpensive dark matter simulations of many Milky Way sized galaxies to:

* statistically probe the merger history of Milky Way-like galaxies, 
* understand the origin and evolution of the satellite systems of Milky Way-like galaxies and 
* determine to what extent the Milky Way is unusual relative to its similar sized cousins.

Our initial suite consisting of tens of halos makes it the largest number of Milky Way sized dark matter halos simulated at extremely high mass and temporal resolution done to date. We plan to extend this initial release sample to 70 halos in total.

We demonstrate excellent convergence over the ranges set by our resolution and present improvements upon current state-of-the-art halo finders to tackle the identification of substructure at such high resolutions. We resolve ~20,000+ gravitationally bound subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo at z = 0. The inner profiles are well fit by Einasto profiles and concentrations follow analytic estimates down to ~5 km s^-1. Our detailed contamination study of over thousands of low resolution halos has resulted in obtaining very large and unprecedented, high-resolution regions around our host halos (sphere of radius ~1 -- 2 Mpc) for our flagship resolution allowing for accurate studies of both low mass dwarf galaxies at large galactocentric radii and the very first stellar systems at high redshift.

So far we have encountered many of the previously known issues within dark matter simulations; the over-abundance of low mass systems when compared to current observations ('missing satellite problem') and that there are too many massive satellite systems (Vmax > 25 km s^-1, i.e. 'too big to fail'). Though we find the severity of the latter problem depends somewhat on the details of the halo finder used. In our initial paper, Griffen et al. (2015, in prep.) we our project goals, new results and information regarding public access (website currently under construction).
