        In a nutshell, I use various technology to better understand where we came from and where we are heading. You can find a little bit about each of these projects below and some of my musings on my semi-active blog. For those that knew me in my earlier days, I've taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research and moved to San Francisco, California where I've co-founded <a href="http://www.scalebiolabs.com">Scaled Biolabs</a>, a biotech company focused on accelerating the advent of the next generation cell therapies. In broad terms, my current activities span the following areas:

       In 2016, three of us took a deep breath and started a biotech company in San Francisco, California. At <a href="http://www.scaledbiolabs.com">Scaled Biolabs</a> we combined microfluidics, stem cell bioengineering and computer science to discover and develop novel cell-based medicines. Put simply, we find intelligent ways to regenerate damaged cells, tissues and organs. For example, in one project we grow neuron's as treatment for Parkinson's Disease.

        Prior to starting Scaled Biolabs, I spent nearly <a href="http://www.brendangriffen.com/astrophysics.html">a decade devoted to academic research</a> in the fields of computational astrophysics, cosmology and theoretical physics. Whilst I have taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research I still have on-going collaborations relating to <a href="http://www.caterpillarproject.org">The Caterpillar Project</a> of which I was the project lead at MIT. I am also contributed to <a href="http://www.illustris-project.org">The Illustris Project</a> pipeline developed at Harvard (<a href="https://youtu.be/NjSFR40SY58">link</a>).

        Using publically available datasets, I (try to) develop more quantitave understanding behind certain ideas we have about culture and language. I develop open source driven toolkits to help study cities, transport networks, migration, how we humans go about our daily business and find hints of where we might be heading.

        I currently consult for the Center For Curriculum Redesign focused where I help build data driven curriculums and ideas for teaching children in the 21st century. Employing natural language processing, ontology networks and general data crunching toolkits, we try to reinvent <a href="http://curriculumredesign.org/ccrknowledgenavigatornetwork/">more effective ways of learning</a>, including not just subject competencies but character qualities as well.

        Providing a quantative window into complex cellular environments underpins much of discovery and development of new cell-based medicines. To achieve this, I deploy various statistical and image processing techniques to process large volumnes of image data (terabytes++) typically found in a biological settings.

        A also spent a fair chunk of time making various electronic things do useful tasks. This includes programming liquid handling robots, Raspberry Pi/Arduino type control, interactive interfaces and other general purpose systems to automate workflows. A lot of this work is devoted toward the systems I build at Scaled Biolabs.
