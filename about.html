        In a nutshell, I use various technologies to better understand where we came from and where we are heading. You can find a little bit about each of these projects below and on my semi-active blog. For those that knew me in my earlier days, I've taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research and moved to San Francisco, California where I've co-founded <a href="https://www.scalebiolabs.com">Scaled Biolabs</a>, a biotech company focused on accelerating the advent of the next generation cell-based medicines. In broad terms, my current activities span the following areas:

       In 2016, I took a deep breath, and co-founded a biotech company in San Francisco, California. At <a href="https://www.scaledbiolabs.com">Scaled Biolabs</a> we combined microfluidics, stem cell engineering and computer science to discover and develop novel cell-based medicines. Put simply, we find intelligent ways to regenerate or grow damaged cells, tissues and organs. In one project we grow neurons as treatment for Parkinson's Disease, for example.

        Prior to starting Scaled Biolabs, I spent nearly <a href="https://www.brendangriffen.com/astrophysics.html">a decade devoted to academic research</a> in the fields of computational astrophysics, cosmology and theoretical physics. Whilst I have taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research I still have on-going collaborations relating to <a href="https://www.caterpillarproject.org">The Caterpillar Project</a> of which I was the project lead at MIT. I also contribute to <a href="https://www.illustris-project.org">The Illustris Project</a> development pipeline at Harvard.

        Using publicly available datasets, I develop more quantitative understanding behind certain ideas we have about culture and language. I develop open source tools to help myself and others study the inner workings of how we humans go about our business (e.g. migration, transport networks) and try find hints of where we might be heading.

        I currently consult for the Center For Curriculum Redesign focused where I help build ontology frameworks for powering a new generation of school curriculum for teaching children in the 21st century. I use natural language processing, semantic networks and other data crunching tools to determine <a href="https://curriculumredesign.org/ccrknowledgenavigatornetwork/">more effective ways of learning</a>, including not just subject competencies but character qualities as well.

        Providing a quantitative window into complex cellular environments underpins much of discovery and development of new cell-based medicines. To study these environments I deploy various statistical and image processing techniques to process large volumes of image data typically found in these biological settings.

        A also spend a fair chunk of time making various electronic systems do useful tasks. This includes programming liquid handling robots, Raspberry Pi/Arduino-type micro-controllers, interactive interfaces and other general purpose systems to automate work flows. A lot of this work is devoted toward the systems I build at Scaled Biolabs.
