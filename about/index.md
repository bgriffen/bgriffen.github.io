I am an astrophysicist and data enthusiast currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics & Space Research at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I'm currently leading the [Caterpillar Project](http://www.caterpillarproject.org) with the objective of better understanding the formation of the Milky Way and its satellite companions. This is being carried out within the [Kavli Institute](http://space.mit.edu/â€Ž) at [MIT](http://mit.edu) and the [Center for Astrophysics](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/). 

On any given day, I can be found investigating these core research topics:

* formation of the satellite population of the Milky Way
* origin of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies
* globular cluster connection to reionization
* dark matter halos and structure formation
* assembly of the old stellar halo

I am also interested in a wide variety of other fields including [using large semantic datasets](http://brendangriffen.com/posts/) as a window into human nature, linguistics and anthropology.
