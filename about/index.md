Hi. I'm Brendan, a computational astrophysicist by training with core interests in biology, engineering and computer science based in San Francisco, California. You can find a few of my musings in these areas on my [projects page]({{ site.url }}/projects/) or at my [semi-active blog]({{ site.url }}/posts/). For those that knew me in my earlier days, I've taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research and co-founded [Scaled Biolabs](https://www.scalebiolabs.com), a biotech company focused on accelerating next generation cell-based medicines.
