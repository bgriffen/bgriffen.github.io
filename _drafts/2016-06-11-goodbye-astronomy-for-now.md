My dance with an astrophysics career has come to an end. On the whole, its been great but I think it is worthwhile going through how I came to be an astrophysicist, what I've learnt over the past 10 years and a hint of where I'm heading. Whilst I am not ruling out a career in academia *entirely*, I do consider it a hiatus that may never end. More on that later. For now, let's start at the beginning. I often receive emails from aspiring scientists not really sure where to go in life and so hopefully this post offers some insight by way of explaining how it all worked out for me.

In 1986, through no choice of my own, I came into this world. My father was an architect in Hong Kong at the time and so as luck would have it, I spent a number of years growing up in China. Don't worry, I wasn't the product of 'Macau entertainment', my mother was also in tow -- happily married. As the picture below from this time period indicates, I was already interested in stuff "up there, beyond the clouds".

<sup>Already a fan of "up there".</sup>

I remember my early school days in China fondly and recall times when a friend of mine and I would jump the back of the school fence and escape into downtown toy stores. I was more easily spotted due to my golden hair which in hindsight, wasn't the best disguise, especially in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. I remember having relatively early 'grown-up' talks with Dad's friends which usually devolved into arguments about how the [Chinese character for chicken](https://www.google.com/search?q=chinese+character+for+chicken&oq=chinese+character+for+chicken&aqs=chrome..69i57.4917j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) looks nothing like a chicken. Fast-forward 10 years and a few cities later, I found myself attending a solid school near [my seaside hometown of Bargara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargara,_Queensland) (population ~5,000) in mid-coast Australia.

During my high school days I was also very fortunate to have two outstanding teachers who took a keen interest in pushing my scientific pursuits. Mr. Deer (physics) and Mr. Peers (mathematics) spent large amounts of their personal time ensuring that everyone got the very best out of their high school years even though it felt like East Germany at times. I wasn't the best student, but I can safely say, it was mainly my interest and supportive mentors that got me to where I am today, not some uber-mensch TCGA DNA combination. Whilst many of my colleagues may be all nature, I assure you my arrival to 2016 has been by way of nurture.

<sup>After school physics tutorials with Mr. Deer were actually fun as my cousin Jack (right) can attest.</sup>

Combining this school environment with a curiosity spurred on by my books I realized around my 14th birthday that i wanted to study astronomy or at the very least a natural science. A photo of my desk around this age(29th of November based on the calendar) indicates a fairly broad interest with a particular focus on history and the natural sciences.

<sup>Where I learnt many things circa ~2001.</sup>

During my 10th year of school we were forced to participate in work experience to give us a taste of the real world. By this point I really was set on studying physics (despite my average grades) and wanted to find somewhere to engage with real world physicists. After some research I found a few universities which took on high-school students for a summer research program. I could count them on one hand but all I needed at the time was just one. The local astronomy club really didn't cut it as it was mainly a re-examination of Saturn's rings or Jupiter's moons every Friday -- I wanted something more.

I applied and was fortunate to get an internship at the Parkes Radio Telescope (yes, where [The Dish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205873/) was filmed) under the tutelage of Rick Twardy (its amazing how names stick after all these years). If you know your Australian geography, Parkes is a [long, long way from my home town](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Bargara+QLD+4670,+Australia/Parkes+NSW+2870,+Australia/data=!4m8!4m7!1m2!1m1!1s0x6bebbffc204bdc31:0x400eef17f20c910!1m2!1m1!1s0x6b1aa9b21e36c657:0x40609b490437c90!3e0) (12 hour drive). Dad volunteered to drive me down and as a bonus promised to visit some of the other astronomy facilities in the Australian countryside. I was stoked.


It was a surreal experience and not what I expected at all. I remember photocopying thousands of pages of books from the library as I never had access to such volumes (remember, this is before the Internet actually had lots of content). I was also fortunate to meet my first real life astronomers. They were, as I recall, and odd bunch of folks with a certain enthusiasm which was infectious. I remember many late nights playing [Abalone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game)) with one chap, discussing the origin of [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar)!

During my school years, my home town was also fortunate to host [Prof. Charlie Lineweaver](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~charley/) as part of an ABC science special in regional Australia. I almost wasn't allowed to attened because of the door person being overly strict on the arrival time. A family friend took time of work to get me to the event (30 minutes away) and I was visibly devestated about not being able to meet one of my heros at the time (I had read all his books and articles). 

I was allowed in after much convincing and during the proceedings I asked what seemed like fairly fundamental questions I was having about the origin of the [False Vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum) (which I still don't fully understand even today). This caught Charlie's ear and he came down to me after and we had a friendly conversation about his recent work. It is so hard to express how vividly I remember those 15 minutes. Mum was kind enought to take our photo at the end of the interaction and as I found out later, [Prof. Tamara Davis](https://smp.uq.edu.au/people/TamaraDavis/) was his PhD student at the time and also in attendence! It was crazy to end up working along side her years later at university. I sent her the image in 2011 and this is what she had to say:

> That is definitely me, and I definitely remember that night (it was my first ever public event like that), and I definitely remember one person in particular asking lots of questions.  Would never have recognised you without being told... but by telling me about the event you completely reaffirmed my belief in giving public talks.

<sup>Outreach really did payoff as meeting Prof. Charlie Lineweaver was the turning point.</sup>

Once this fantastic experience was behind me, I set about getting into university which was the only avenue available to study astronomy open to me. I did enough work to get the grades, nothing more and spent the rest of my spare time in books or reading the photocopy material from my work experience. 

Whilst I was building up my knowledge of physics and sparking an ever growing desire to study it long term I also had a great location during my down time to just think. A lot of these creative musings came about during long stays with Mum in the hinterland of the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, Australia as the house she lived in was 'spartan' to say the least. Compost outdoor toilets, rain water, solar energy/hot water, wind turbine, veggie gardens, candles by night, no walls and a giant tree up the middle of the house acting like a staircase all backed by a national rainforest. Classic Sunshine Coast if you've ever been there.

<sup>Lots of time to hang out in nature and just ask questions.</sup>


Here, I spent hundreds of hours asking family friends all sorts of questions about the world, especially physics and history. The night sky was like nothing I've ever seen as it was farm land in the country. The alluvial views made a great backdrop for night time ponderings over a game of chess and cup of tea.

[![images](/assets/goodbye/view.jpg)](/assets/goodbye/view.jpg)  
<sup>Quite the view from home.</sup>



I ended up attending one of the default universities in the capital city of my state and set about on my journey to become an astronomer which was still largely unknown waters. The university offered no astronomy courses until my second year they brought one in then in my third year two more. This pales in comparison to what is available at places like MIT or Caltech for instance but I'm me in east cupcake Australia. Each semester I saught out internships at other universities around Australia and was fortunate to get a three month stint at Mt. Stromolo which at the time was the best astronomy institute in Australia.

I soldiered on in my degree and then faced the hardest intellectual challenge of my life -- my Honours (or Masters in one year for USA folks). It was a torturous affair and many nights were lost and friendships gained in the hallowed halls of the physics department. I remember staying up for two days straight prior to submitting my thesis with no guarantee that I would get the grades required to obtain a PhD scholarship (90% or above at the time). The final courses were things like condensed matter physics, computational physics and the dreaded quantum field theory. Not a single course was astronomy so 50% of my time was doing Feynman diagrams whilst the other 50% of my time was spent looking at small galaxies dissolving into other galaxies in simulations -- zero overlap.
