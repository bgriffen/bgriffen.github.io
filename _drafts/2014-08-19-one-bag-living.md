Diogenes of Sinope (or Diogenes "the Cynic") was a founder of Cynic philosophy who lived in Corinth in the late 4th century B.C. He was famous for his quips and his extremly simple way of living. He subscribed to simple living so much that he thought fit to try and debase the currency of Sinope (his father worked in the mint). He was banished for his actions and returned later with great determination to live even simpler. He was a strong proponent of leading by example and so he took it to the extreme by holding up in a large jar in the market place surviving on donations from tourists. During the day he would carry a lamp around town looking for "an honest man". [Famously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_of_Sinope#Diogenes_and_Alexander) he mocked Alexander the Great:


> Diogenes was relaxing in the sunlight in the morning, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight". Later, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave."

Whilst I don't aim to become Diogenes there is something in his ideal which appeals to me. It has long been a goal of mine to reduce the number of possessions I own to the point I can put nearly everything I need in a single backpack. My main goal is purely simplicity. Rather than taking everything I own and reducing it down item by item, I decided to start with a clean slate and make a list of things I actually need to live. I've tried to break my belongings down into three categories largely in order of importance. 

### Tier 1: base human needs

#### Food

In order to make food I'll need a stove and refrigerator. 

#### Water

This conveniently comes with rent -- a luxury compared to many parts of the world.

#### Shelter

Living where I do now is among the most expensive places to live in the United States. There isn't much I can do about this apart from selecting wisely and being above all, patient. The difference between a 1500 per month and 1200 per month apartment over a year (2 people) is 3600 dollars -- a non-negligible amount of coin. Fortunately, I live with someone which cuts what I actually pay right down.

### Tier 2: so as to not cause a scene

#### Transport

Fortunately I live in a town which is very bike friendly. I borrowed a bike off a friend when I arrived and have invested in a few repairs. When it is -30 degrees outside I take the train.

#### Clothing

Now this group of items depends entirely on your environment and level of comfort. Over the last few months I made a list of the events I attended and the clothing required. I came down to the following categories:


Sports:

* 1x runners
* 1x quick-dry pants
* 1x quick-dry shirt

Day/Work:

* 2x cargo shorts (summer)
* 2x long pants (winter)
* 5x v-neck shirts, 1x long-sleeve

Smart Casual:

* 1x polo shirt
* 1x button-up shirt

Formal:

* 1x black pants
* 1x black shoes
* 2x belt (day/formal)
* 1x tie

Shoes: 

* 1x hiking 
* 1x runners 
* 1x formal 
* 1x sandles

Addional: 

* 5x white socks
* 1x black socks
* 7x underwear

Many of the items overlap into both categories and this is intentional -- I want to maximize functionality whilst minimizing quantity.

### Tier 3: items I could (mostly) do without.

#### Tech

* 1x laptop
* 1x cordless mini-mouse
* 1x mobile (cell) phone
* 1x camera
* 1x headphones
* 1x kindle
* 1x watch
* 1x external 1TB hard drive

#### Furniture

* 1x couch  
* 1x bed  
* 1x coffee table  
* 1x porch table  
* 1x high kitchen table  
* 2x porch chairs  
* 1x office desk  

#### Applicances
* 1x toaster  
* 4x knife and fork set  
* 1x deep pot  
* 1x non-stick pan  
* 4x plates  
* 4x bowls  
* 4x mini-plates  
* 4x tupperware  
* 2x cooking tray  
* 1x cooking utensil set  

### Extras

* wallet  
* keys  
* passport  
* document folder  
* ukelele  
* chess set  
* stationery  
* toiletries  
* sunglasses  
* shampoo & conditioner  
* U.S. Map  

### The Bag

After much though I decided to go with the [Tom Bihn Aviator](http://www.tombihn.com/travel_bags/aeronaut30.html) bag which is a maximum legal carry-on (MLC) rated bag made of ballistic nylon which will last me until the next age. I looked through them all, [Deuter](http://www.deuter.com/US/us/lightweight-484.html), [Osprey](http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/backpacking/farpoint_55), the [Minaal](http://www.minaal.com/) etc. and I honestly couldn't find anything else which topped its quality and functionality. I've already taken it on multiple trips overseas and I can honestly say, its the best thing I own. I also own two other bags, one for hiking and the backpack which I arrived with ([One Planet Tom Thumb 65L](http://www.oneplanet.com.au/travelbags.html)). I am currently trying to sell these now.

### Final Thoughts

So let's see - that's *~50 items total*. There are no caverns full of clothes tucked away somewhere in my house -- that's *everything* to my name. Nearly everything in Tier 3 was free as many colleagues/friends no longer needed the items. A great majority of the furniture was found on the street about to be turned into land fill. When I move countries again, I'll sell all of that off and I will indeed be able to leave as I arrived -- with one bag.

Lastly, there are no right or wrong answers on what one should own. I personally feel psychologically liberated having gone right back to the basics. If you're interested in getting started, make a list of all the things you own and if you haven't used something in six months, why not donate it? What have you got to lose? :)
