English is one of the few languages that can get away without using any <i>diacritics</i> &mdash; the little dots, lines and so on that sit above or below letters, as in *é* or *ü*.

Many languages that, like English, use the Roman alphabet, depend on diacritics to express different sounds. For example, the German sound represented by [u] is different from the sound represented by [ü].

When it comes to languages that use entirely different alphabets like Japanese and Arabic, linguists have had to find ways to represent them in the Roman alphabet in order to make them intelligible to people who can’t read the original. For example, you may not be able to read 寿司, but you can certainly read *sushi*, which is a different way of writing the same sound.

There are an endless number of ways of capturing foreign sounds in our alphabet, and some are better than others. You may have been confused at school, as I was, by the suggestion that *Peking*, the capital of China, changed its name to *Beijing*. In fact, it didn’t change anything &mdash; we did. *Peking* and *Beijing* are two ways of representing one sound, written in Chinese as 北京. *Peking* was simply one old system used to write Chinese words in English, and it was replaced by the current system.

If you’re learning Mandarin, though, you know that *Beijing* is not entirely accurate, either. When we write it in English, we leave out the diacritics which show *tones*, a feature of pronunciation in Chinese languages involving pitch variation of syllables. If we include the tone marks, *Beijing* looks like *běijīng*.

*Transliteration* refers to the pratice of writing languages that use other alphabets in one’s own alphabet. For example, you could write the Japanese word for “thank you” as *arigatō* instead of its original form, ありがとう.

Regardless of what some people say about transliteration being detrimental to the efforts of people learning a foreign writing system, it can still be a useful tool in some situations. You might need to quickly jot down a new word and don’t have time to write it the real way, for example. It’s also very helpful for beginners who want to learn vocabulary but haven’t got the foreign writing system down pat.

Also, transliteration is excellent when writing for an audience that aren’t necessarily interested in learning the language, but need to be able to pronounce certain foreign words or names accurately — for example, those studying history or sociology.



With most languages that use non-Roman writing systems, there is a more accurate way to represent the sounds of the language than standard English letters.

For people learning Japanese, the city of Osaka 大阪 is usually written as *ōsaka*, because that [o] sound at the beginning is actually the length of two syllables. This sound is also in *gyōza* 餃子 and *sumō* 相撲.

For people learning Arabic, the month of Ramadan رمضان is *ramaḍān*: Arabic has two different sounds that English speakers hear as [d], written as د and ض, or in our alphabet, *d* and *ḍ*. The *ā* represents a long [a] sound.

For people learning Thai, the noodle dish *pad thai* (“Thai noodles”) ##GET THAI VERSION## is written as *pad thai*.
