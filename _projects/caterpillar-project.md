The goal of the [*Caterpillar Project*](http://www.caterpillarproject.org/) is to use relatively inexpensive dark matter simulations of many Milky Way sized dark matter halos to:

* statistically probe the merger history of Milky Way-like galaxies, 
* understand the origin and evolution of the satellite systems of Milky Way-like galaxies and 
* determine to what extent the Milky Way is unusual relative to its similar sized cousins.

Our initial suite consisting of 24 of halos makes it the largest number of Milky Way sized dark matter halos simulated at extremely high mass and temporal resolution done to date. We plan to extend this initial release sample to 70 halos in total.

In [Griffen et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1509.01255) we present the following:

> We present the largest number of Milky Way sized dark matter halos simulated at extremely high mass (~\\({\rm 10^4\ M_\odot}\\) per particle) and temporal resolution (5 Myrs/snapshot) done to date, quadrupling what is currently available in the literature. This initial suite consists of the first 24 halos of the *Caterpillar Project* whose project goal of 60-70 halos will be made public when complete. We resolve ~20,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo. Over the ranges set by our spatial resolution our resolution is excellent and improvements upon current state-of-the-art halo finders to better identify substructure at such high resolutions (e.g., on average we recover âˆ¼4 subhalos in each host halo above \\(10^8\ M_\odot\\) which would have otherwise not been found using conventional methods). For our relaxed halos, the inner profiles are reasonably fit by Einasto profiles (\\(\alpha = 0.169 \pm 0.023\\)) though this depends on the relaxed nature and assembly history of a given halo. The substructure mass fractions of, \\(f_{m,subs} = 0.121 \pm 0.041\\), and mass function slopes are \\(dN/dM\propto M^{-1.88 \pm 0.10}\\) though we find scatter in the normalizations for fixed halo mass due to more concentrated hosts having less subhalos at fixed subhalo mass. There are no biases stemming from Lagrangian volume selection. All Lagrangian volume types are included in our sample. Our detailed contamination study of over 264 low resolution halos has resulted in obtaining very large and unprecedented, high-resolution regions around our host halos for our target resolution (sphere of radius ~\\(1.4 \pm 0.4 Mpc\\)) allowing for accurate studies of low mass dwarf galaxies at large galactocentric radii and the very first stellar systems at high redshift.
