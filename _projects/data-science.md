When I have spare time, I find ways of exploiting large datasets online (ideally semantic) to learn something new about human culture. Some of my previous projects include the following areas:

* currency exchange maps (jQuery & Python)
* language translation (XML, CSS & Python)
* human disease networks (DBpedia, Python)
* sentiment analysis within social networks (PATTERN suite, Python)
* quantifying character relationships within English literature using NLP (Python)
* improving transportation networks (Python)
* interactive maps of the development of human ideas (JSON,DBpedia, SPARQL, Gephi, Python)

Many of these appear in my semi-periodic blog posts and others are for private entities.
