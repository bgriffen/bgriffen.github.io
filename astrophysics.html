            The advent of more sophisticated computing codes and cheaper more powerful hardware has ushered in a new age of scientific discovery. Over the past eight or so years I've spent most of my working time on problems of astrophysical relevance. Although I'm now working in biotechnology, I still am involved in a number of astrophysics projects that largely revolve around exploiting data stemming from <a href="http://www.caterpillarproject.org">The Caterpillar Project</a>.

            Scientific papers, for better or worse, are the current currency in the academic system. So far I've been involved in a number of interesting projects which used supercomputers to probe the non-linear regime of galaxy formation. Here is a short list of projects (papers) I've been involved in over the years.

        In this work I exploited the high resolution of The Caterpillar Project to study the first stellar systems of the proto-Milky Way. Using five times as many simulations than previously used, we investigated the formation environment of the first stellar systems and connected them to present day satellite systems.

        This paper was the culmination of two years work. With collaborators at MIT, we more than quadrupled the number of simulations of the Milky Way available to astronomers worldwide. Our extremely high mass resolution and temporal resolution makes this dataset a one of a kind laboratory to study the evolution of the Milky Way and its similar sized cousins.

        In this work we looked at how globular clusters contributed to the reionization of the Universe 10-13 billion years ago. Using radiative transfer simulations, we found that their contributions to reionization is non-negligible. Their impact, particular on smaller galaxies forming in subsequent epochs, can drastically affect the distribution of galaxies found in the night sky today.

        In this work we looked at how dense stellar systems, called globular clusters, can form naturally from two epochs within hierarchical galaxy formation. Metal poor and old globular clusters can arise naturally from cooling gas in the early universe and metal-rich and young globular clusters can arise from the merging of galaxies in much more recent times which still occurs today.

          The Locations Of Long-lived Low-Mass First Stars</span><br/>
          The search for metal-free stars has so far been unsuccessful, proving that if there are surviving stars from the first generation, they are rare, they have been polluted or we have been looking in the wrong place. In this work, led by Mattias Magg, a semi-analytic model coupled to the Caterpillar suite was used to predict where the first stars reside today.

          Extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the Milky Way allow us to infer the properties of their progenitors by comparing their chemical composition to the metal yields of the first supernovae. This work, led by Tilman Hartwig, used a powerful  semi-analytic model, which includes chemical and radiative feedback, to create a diagnostic to better understand a sub-class of these EMP stars.

        A recent surge in the discovery of new ultrafaint dwarf satellites of the Milky Way has inspired the idea of searching for faint satellites around less massive field galaxies in the Local Group.  In this work, Greg Dooley computed the predicted number of satellites in a given field of view of specific Local Group galaxies, as a function of minimum satellite luminosity.

        In this work we used a high resolution simulation of the Milky Way (in fact, 30+ of them) to determine where the best place today would be to find the first stars from the early Universe. Lead by Mattis Magg, we found Population III stars (early stars) are more likely to exist in the satellites of the Milky Way (orbiting small galaxies) rather than the Milky Way itself.

        Mergers and the spin of the dark matter halo are factors traditionally believed to determine the morphology of galaxies. In this work, we studied this hypothesis by studying galaxies selected from the Illustris simulation. We found that the fraction of accreted stars increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass and the impact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly.

        In this work Joel Pfeffer compared the predictions of a semi-analytic model for ultra-compact dwarf galaxy formation by tidal stripping to the observed properties of globular clusters and UCDs in the Fornax and Virgo clusters. These results suggest that observed GC+UCD populations are a combination of genuine GCs and stripped nuclei.

        <span class="projectlistheading">12.2015 &mdash; How Do Galaxy Populations Change Over Time?</span><br>
        Cumulative number density is commonly used to link galaxy populations across different epochs by assuming that galaxies preserve their number density in time. In this work, Paul Torrey studied the the extent to which this assumption holds in the presence of galaxy mergers or when rank ordering is broken owing to variable stellar growth rates.

        Illustris is a suite of large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code AREPO and includes a comprehensive set of physical models critical for following the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. It consists of five compnents: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes.

        In this work Joel Pfeffer used the cosmological simulation coupled with a semi-analytic model to predict the contribution of galactic nuclei formed by the tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies to globular cluster and ultracompact dwarf galaxy populations of galaxies. We concluded that most ultra-compact dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters are likely the high-mass end of the globular cluster mass function.

        In this work Greg Dooley looked at how cosmological parameters affected the properties of galaxies. Although there are a surprisingly small number of parameters required to simulated a universe, subtle changes can result in overall galaxy properties in interesting ways. We used cosmological simulations with different parameters to measure these effects in a systematic manner.
