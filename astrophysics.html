            The advent of more sophisticated computing codes and cheaper more powerful hardware has ushered in a new age of scientific discovery. Over the past eight or so years I've spent most of my working time on problems of astrophysical relevance. Although I'm now working in biotechnology, I still am involved in a number of astrophysics projects that largely revolve around exploiting data stemming from <a href="http://www.caterpillarproject.org">The Caterpillar Project</a>.

            Scientifc papers, for better or worse, are the current currency in the academic system. So far I've been involved in a number of interesting projects which used supercomputers to probe the non-linear regime of galaxy formation. Here is a short list of projects (papers) I've been involved in over the years.

        <span class="projectlistheading">How Do Globular Clusters Form &amp; Evolve?</span><br />
        In this work I used the highest resolution simulation of the Milky Way ever done to investigate the formation of dense stellar systems known as globular clusters. These are ancient systems and are tracers of the earlier history of the Universe. In this work I found that two populations of these kinds of systems can arise naturally from two different phases of how a galaxy forms.

        <span class="projectlistheading">Do Globular Clusters Contribute To Reionization?</span><br />
        Following on from the previous work I used a radiative transfer code to model how early stellar systems heated up the Universe. This early energy contribution results in drastic consequences for subsequent generations stellar populations and shaped how the Milky Way is structured today. This was the first detailed computational exploration of its kind.

        <span class="projectlistheading">Simulating The Milky Way</span><br />
        This paper was the culmination of two years work. With collaborators at MIT, we more than quadrupled the number of simulations of the Milky Way available to astronomers worldwide. Our extremely high mass resolution and temporal resolution makes this dataset a one of a kind laboratory to study the evolution of the Milky Way and its similar sized cousins.

        In this work I exploited the high resolution of The Caterpillar Project to study the first stellar systems of the proto-Milky Way. Using five times as many simulations than previously used, we investigated the formation environment of the first stellar systems and connected them to present day satellite systems.

        <span class="projectlistheading">How Do Cosmological Parameters Effect Galaxies?</span><br />
        In this work Greg Dooley looked at how cosmological parameters affected the properties of galaxies. Although there are a suprisingly small number of parameters required to simulated a universe, subtle changes can result in overall galaxy properties in interesting ways. We used cosmological simulations with different parameters to measure these effects in a systematic manner.

        <span class="projectlistheading">Making The Most Compact Galaxies In The Universe</span><br />
        In this work Joel Pfeffer used the cosmological simulation coupled with a semi-analytic model to predict the contribution of galactic nuclei formed by the tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies to globular cluster and ultracompact dwarf galaxy populations of galaxies. We concluded that most ultra-compact dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters are probably simply the high-mass end of the globular cluster mass function.

        <span class="projectlistheading">The Illustris Simulation</span><br>
        Illustris is a suite of large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code AREPO and includes a comprehensive set of physical models critical for following the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. It consists of five compnents: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes.

        <span class="projectlistheading">How Do Galaxy Populations Change Over Time?</span><br>
        Cumulative number density is commonly used to link galaxy populations across different epochs by assuming that galaxies preserve their number density in time. In this work, Paul Torrey studied the the extent to which this assumption holds in the presence of galaxy mergers or when rank ordering is broken owing to variable stellar growth rates.

        <span class="projectlistheading">How Do The Largest Galaxies Shape The Smallest Galaxies?</span><br/>
        In this work Joel Pfeffer compared the predictions of a semi-analytic model for ultra-compact dwarf galaxy formation by tidal stripping to the observed properties of globular clusters and UCDs in the Fornax and Virgo clusters. These results suggest that observed GC+UCD populations are a combination of genuine GCs and stripped nuclei, with the contribution of stripped nuclei increasing towards the high-mass end.

        <span class="projectlistheading">How Does Galaxy Merging Drive Galaxy Formation?</span><br/>
        Mergers and the spin of the dark matter halo are factors traditionally believed to determine the morphology of galaxies. In this work, we studied this hypothesis by studying galaxies selected from the Illustris simulation. We found that the fraction of accreted stars increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass and the impact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly.

        A recent surge in the discovery of new ultrafaint dwarf satellites of the Milky Way has inspired the idea of searching for faint satellites around less massive field galaxies in the Local Group.  In this work, Greg Dooley computed the predicted number of satellites in a given field of view of specific Local Group galaxies, as a function of minimum satellite luminosity.
