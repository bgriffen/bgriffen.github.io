This post is the first in a series focusing on bits of grammar that I’ve noticed have confused lots of teachers.

Please kind in mind that this is only aimed at educating native and very advanced speakers of English &mdash; you need to be careful when and how you present this stuff to students so as not to scare the living daylights out of them. **I strongly believe a [lexical approach][lex] à la Michael Lewis is usually better than teaching grammar in the classroom explicity.**

This is for teachers’ eyes only. My goal is to help teachers understand their own language better so that when curious (or cocky) students put you on the spot, you still seem like someone who is capable of doing what they’re being paid to do.

Not only that, having a solid understanding of grammar will improve your teaching indirectly in ways you don’t expect. Everything becomes easier and you will get new and better ideas, including ones that involve teaching lexically.

Let’s get on with it.

## Transitive vs. intransitive verbs ##

What’s the difference between the two meanings of *boils* in these sentences?

1. *Mark boils the water before adding the pasta.*
2. *Water boils at 100 degrees.*

It’s not a simple case of changing the subject &mdash; Mark doesn’t boil at 100 degrees, although parts of him might.

The difference is that you’ve got two different words here: *boil (something)* as in “make something reach boiling point” and *boil* as in “reach boiling point”. The former is transitive and the latter is intransitive.

A transitive verb needs an *object*. In (1), that object is *the water*. In (2), though, there’s no object, so it isn’t transitive.

*At 100 degrees* is not an object &mdash; it’s not even a noun or noun phrase; it’s an *[adjunct][adjunct]*, which you can think of as “extra” information that is not a subject, verb or object.  You can leave out adjuncts and still have a correct sentence. It’s still OK to say *water boils*, even if it’s a bit weird. But if you say *Mark boils* without saying *the water*, it changes the meaning entirely and now sounds like the script for a C-grade horror movie, i.e. it has now become intransitive because we took away the object.

## How to tell if a verb is transitive ##

A good way to test if a verb is transitive is putting *it* after it and checking if it makes sense. For example, the verb *read* can be both transitive and intransitive:

- *I love reading.*
- *I love reading it.*

*Sleep*, however, is intransitive:

- *She’s sleeping.*
- *<s>She’s sleeping it.</s>*

And *like* is transitive, which leads to one of the most common learner errors in English:

- *<s>I like.</s>*
- *I like it.*

A few verbs are *ditransitive* (as opposed to *monotransitive*), which means they require two objects. *Give* is a good example:

- *<s>Give me!</s>*
- *<s>Give your wallet!</s>*
- *Give me your wallet!*

It is well worth teaching students about this difference if they prefer a grammar-centric approach, because most dictionaries list this parameter. To grammar-minded students, it can be very useful in guessing how to use a verb.

Example from [Macmillan Dictionary][mac]:

For students that don’t dig grammar, it might be worth pointing out that some verbs need to have a “thing” after them, i.e. you can’t say *I like*. It’s up to you how you want to explain it, but the important thing is that *you* understand it yourself. 

## Where it gets complicated ##

There are two things that make life difficult here.

The first is that both subjects and objects can be really long, making them hard to recognize. Consider this:

- *I love being outside when it’s raining.*

Where’s the object here? In fact, the object is *being outside when it’s raining*. Again, a handy way to test this is to use the word *it*. If you substitute the phrase *I love it*, what is the *it* replacing? What do you love? *Being outside when it’s raining.* Now try this one:

- *Bush’s seemingly endless gaffes revealed what some might call a lack of intelligence.*

*Revealed* is transitive here. The subject is *Bush’s seemingly endless gaffes* and the object is *what some might call a lack of intelligence*. You can see this for yourself by substituting *it* again: *Bush’s seemingly endless gaffes revealed it.* What’s *it* replacing? *What some might call a lack of intelligence*, that’s what.

The second thing that complicates life is that words don’t always manifest as the same part of speech.

Take *yesterday*, for instance. Usually, it’s an adverb, as in:

- *Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away*.

But that isn’t always the case. Sometimes it’s a noun:

- *Yesterday came suddenly.*

If a Japanese or Korean learner of English had said the latter sentence, you’d have to deduce from context whether they were singing a Beatles song or sharing an anecdote about their friend making an unexpected house call (erroneously omitting the subject as you can do in Japanese and Korean: *yesterday* he *came suddenly*). Actually, I’ve just thought of a third possibility too, but we won’t go into that.

This ambiguity comes from the two functions of *yesterday* as an adverb and as a noun. In the first sentence, when it’s an adverb, the subject is *all my troubles*. In the second sentence, when it’s a noun, it *is* the subject. *The day itself* came suddenly. If you substitute *it* &mdash; or *they* for plurals &mdash; this is apparent:

- *Yesterday, they came suddenly.* (What did? *All my troubles.*)
- *It came suddenly.* (What did? *Yesterday.*)

Try this with any other word or group of words there, and it doesn’t work:

1. *It, all my troubles seemed so far away.* (Sorry, what?)
2. *Yesterday, all my troubles seemed it.* (What the… I don’t even…)
3. *Yesterday came it.* (OK, I’m going to go stand over there now.)

You can use this test to find out if a word is a subject or object. *Yesterday* failed the test in (1); *so far away* failed in (2) and *suddenly* in (3). What does that mean? They’re all adjuncts, so they can be neither subjects nor objects.

Look at the examples again. Are *seem* and *come* transitive, or intransitive?

**Summary: If you can substitute *it*, *they/them*, *he/him* or *she/her* for a chunk of words, that means 1) that chunk is a noun phrase, and 2) it’s either a subject or object. If it comes after the verb, then it is an object, and the verb is transitive.**

That’s it for now. To improve, start keeping an eye out for verbs in your daily life and try to figure out whether they’re transitive. If the *boil* example did your head in, read up about [ergative verbs][erg].
