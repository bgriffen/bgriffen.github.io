Almost every English teacher I’ve met has tried and given up learning another language. Sometimes they manage to get to a level where they can have a basic conversation, but it hardly ever progresses beyond there. They might have taken classes while living overseas, but these inevitably lead to excuses that “it’s actually a really hard language” or “I was OK with the grammar but I couldn’t get my speaking to improve”.

Here’s the dirty little secret: the reason ESL teachers don’t speak other languages to any real level of skill is that *they don’t know how to learn languages*.

Think about this for a moment. Language teaching is the only educational field in which the people who are supposed to be teaching actually have *less* experience doing the thing they’re teaching than the students. A tutor at med school has at least finished med school, a soccer coach has trained for years and grown the brain tissue necessary to be good at soccer, but an English teacher, in most cases, has no idea what it’s like to learn English as a second language.

Of course, this doesn’t apply to non-native teachers, who deserve much more respect than they’re given. But even non-natives, if they’re very good, likely didn’t learn English the same way they’re teaching it. It’s more likely they learned through a much more coherent and effective process involving massive amounts of context-based input, output and constant feedback. This is what the native teachers almost always fail to do when they learn other languages.

So how are we supposed to learn languages, then?

I admit I’m kind of a language-learning junkie. I’ve spent hours reading [blogs][mezzo], listening to [podcasts][podcasts], watching [YouTube][YT] and lurking on forums, looking for ways to make the process more efficient. (Most of that time could have been better spent being exposed to the L2, mind you.) But you hardly have to step foot into the online language-learning community to find a huge wealth of resources. There are countless [blogs][luca], [forums][howtoforums] and [apps][anki] that will show you how to get a language into your head. All it takes is a Google search.

Teachers generally have no idea about all this. They live in an ESL bubble in which the only ways to study English involve grammar textbooks, worksheets and exercises, and &mdash; if you’ve got any time left over after homework &mdash; reading and listening to English (“just have fun with it!”). Whenever I’ve mentioned things like shadowing, mimicking, intensive vs. extensive listening/reading, mnemonics, spaced repetition, Pimsleur, and so on, I’ve gotten blank looks from the other teachers.

No wonder they don’t have much success learning languages themselves.

The most tragically ironic thing in all of this is when ESL students ask their teacher, “how can I improve my vocabulary?” or “how can I improve my listening?” 

Asking a monolingual English speaker for language-learning tips is like asking a person for travel tips for a city they’ve never been to. “Um, Paris? I heard the Eiffel Tower is good. And the Louvre, definitely go to the Louvre.” The student would be better off hearing a frank admission of ignorance, of course, but that would be unthinkable &mdash; after all, we’re supposed to be experts! Better to seem like we know what we’re talking about. *I know some books with the word “vocabulary” in the title, so I’ll recommend those. That’ll do. Here, have more worksheets.*

The academic-approved textbook approach works for a tiny minority of motivated students who enjoy picking apart grammatical structures and doing exercises, and can apply that knowledge when they speak. But it is treated as a one-size-fits-all solution, and anyone who has difficulty with it is told to do more.

Guess what, teachers: it’s you who has to do more. In fact, most of your job is no longer relevant now that we have the Internet. Anyone can hand out worksheets, press the “play” button on a DVD, and correct people’s errors. The only things of lasting value you can do for your students now are:

1. Motivate them.
2. Show them how to find stuff in English that isn’t mind-numbingly boring or too difficult.
3. Teach them how to learn (i.e. wean them off language classes).

If you suck at the first one, consider a career change. But the Internet makes the other two easy. A person with a smartphone and laptop who wants to learn a language now has no barriers in front of them. The problem is that they don’t know what they need, or how to find it. [That’s where you come in][languagemanager].

If you don’t know how to do this, you’re not qualified to be answering people’s questions about improving their English. You can’t teach people how to learn if you don’t know how to do it yourself.

The good news is that there’s nothing stopping you from finding out.
