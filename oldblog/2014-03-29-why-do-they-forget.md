This is more or less what I’ve overheard hundreds of times from ESL teachers in the staffroom after a disappointing reminder of their students’ lack of progress.

Teachers seem very quick to jump to the conclusion that their students are thinking lazily and therefore forget to put in things like *a*, *the*, *is* and the like.

This is possibly a case of [self-serving bias][ssb]. Teachers generally take credit for their students’ successes, but sidestep the burden of responsibility for their failures. (Students do this too, in reverse.)

Interestingly though, in a lot of cases, such as misusing articles, the failure that the teacher is not willing to acknowledge can be a red herring. The reason that the student is still making grammatical mistakes might be neither the teacher’s failure nor the student’s. It might be that the student’s [interlanguage][inter] hasn’t absorbed the new pattern yet &mdash; pretty likely after only a little conscious exposure to it. If this is the case, then the teacher has some incorrect assumptions about how learning works.

The conversation below, from Braine (1971), is a famous one to linguists.

<ul class="conversation" style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: none; color: #999; border-left: 10px solid #f1f1f1;">
<li><b>Child:</b> Want other one spoon, Daddy.</li>
<li><b>Father:</b> You mean, you want THE OTHER SPOON.</li>
<li><b>Child:</b> Yes, I want other one spoon, please Daddy.</li>
<li><b>Father:</b> Can you say “the other spoon”?</li>
<li><b>Child:</b> Other … one … spoon.</li>
<li><b>Father:</b> Say “other”.</li>
<li><b>Child:</b> Other.</li>
<li><b>Father:</b> “Spoon”.</li>
<li><b>Child:</b> Spoon.</li>
<li><b>Father:</b> “Other … spoon.”</li>
<li><b>Child:</b> Other … spoon. Now give me other one spoon?</li>
</ul>

If you are a teacher, this is no doubt familiar. Why isn’t the child getting it? Could you seriously argue that it’s due to laziness?

Although adults tend to be better at this than children, it seems there’s something more going on than being lazy or “forgetting”. People’s brains are wired differently &mdash; some pick up new language on the first try and some take an excruciating amount of repetition. (If you’re interested, there’s a whole field of linguistics research on this called [second-language acquisition][sla].)

Imagine if the father in the conversation had scolded his child: “Just use your brain! We’ve already gone through this!” The kid’s motivation to learn English isn’t going to drop, because it’s their first language. But enough of this kind of reaction might just be enough to kill your ESL students’ motivation. 

It’s a waste of time to get frustrated by something that is under neither you nor your students’ conscious control. Instead, if they can’t get a chunk of language right, remind them it sometimes takes lots of exposure, then find ways to sneak it into the lesson over the next few weeks.

Even then, they might not get it &mdash; and there’s [research][order] that suggests learners acquire bits of language in a particular order, regardless of how much you try to get them to use it now.

Be patient. If you get can get them to love English instead of hating their own inadequacies, their prospects will be far better.
