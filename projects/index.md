    <h1>Scaled Biolabs Inc.</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Accelerating next generation cell-based medicines.</div>
    <p>In 2016, I took a deep breath, and co-founded a biotech company in San Francisco, California. At Scaled Biolabs we combined microfluidics, stem cell engineering and computer science to discover and develop novel cell-based medicines. Put simply, we find intelligent ways to regenerate or grow damaged cells, tissues and organs. In one project we grow neurons as treatment for Parkinson's Disease, for example.</p>

    <h1>Computational Astrophysics</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Using supercomputers to understand the origin and evolution of our Universe.</div>
    <p>Prior to starting Scaled Biolabs, I spent nearly a decade devoted to academic research in the fields of computational astrophysics, cosmology and theoretical physics. Whilst I have taken a hiatus from formal astrophysics research I still have on-going collaborations relating to The Caterpillar Project of which I was the project lead at MIT. I also contribute to The Illustris Project development pipeline at Harvard.</p>

    <h1>Computer Vision &amp; Machine Learning</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Also known as applied statistics and linear algebra but that isn't a catchy heading.</div>
    <p>Providing a quantitative window into complex cellular environments underpins much of discovery and development of new cell-based medicines. To study these environments I deploy various statistical and image processing techniques to process large volumes of image data typically found in these biological settings.</p>

    <h1>Engineering</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Trying to make collections of atoms do useful things.</div>
    <p>I spend a fair chunk of time making various electronic systems do useful tasks. This includes programming liquid handling robots, Raspberry Pi/Arduino-type micro-controllers, interactive interfaces and other general purpose systems to automate work flows. A lot of this work is devoted toward the systems I build at Scaled Biolabs.</p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Data-driven frameworks for learning in the 21st century.</div>
    <p>I periodically consult for the <a href="http://curriculumredesign.org">Center For Curriculum Redesign</a> focused where I help build ontology frameworks for powering a new generation of school curricula. Using natural language processing, semantic networks and other data crunching tools, we strive to determine more effective ways of learning.</p>
